# CCACWelfareGeneration
In this work, we propose a model that minimizes costs, maximizes generator rewards, and ensures that the energy produced within the EC is efficiently utilized by its members. Additionally, we develop an algorithm that integrates replicator dynamics (RD) with a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) to solve welfare maximization problem.
